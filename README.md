# MO_HEALTH_Covid_Tracking

This repository contains the data set creation scripts that power for the [Missouri COVID-19 Tracking Project](http://slu-opengis.github.io/covid_daily_viz/). These were originally housed in the same [repository](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/covid_daily_viz) as the data visualization code, but have been separated as part of the conversion of the original code into a more modular, better documented set of resources.
